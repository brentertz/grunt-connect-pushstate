# grunt-connect-pushstate

> A grunt plugin that provides connect middleware to rewrite select requests to the site root, thus allowing for pushstate routing.
>
> Requests including a file extension are left untouched so site assets like your images, stylesheets, and JavaScripts will load unaffected, while requests without a file extension, presumably pages or actions within your site, are rewritten to point at the site's root, with the original URL intact, thus allowing your pushstate router to take over.
> 
> This plugin is designed for use with the [grunt-contrib-connect](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect) plugin.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-connect-pushstate --save
```

### Overview

Load the middleware by adding the following line of JavaScript to the top of your project's Gruntfile.

```js
var pushState = require('grunt-connect-pushstate/lib/utils').pushState;
```

Adjust the "connect" task by adding the pushState middleware call to the connect options middleware hook, amongst your other middleware. Note that connect.static is needed as well.

```js
connect: {
  options: {
    hostname: 'localhost',
    port: 3000,
    base: 'www/',
    middleware: function (connect, options) {
      return [
        // Rewrite requests to root so they may be handled by router
        pushState,

        // Serve static files
        connect.static(options.base)
      ];
    }
  }
}
```

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

*Suggestions for improvement and/or added flexibility are very welcome. :)*
